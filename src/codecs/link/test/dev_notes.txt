This is the test case to parse SGT(Security Group Tag/Trustsec) from CiscoMetaData.

CiscoMetaData - A proprietary header in ethernet layer, called CiscoMetaDataHdr.
                After CiscoMetaDataHdr, packet contains CiscoMetaDataOpt which carries
                SGT data.

Here created a dummy packet which has CiscoMetaDataHdr integrated and pushing it to layer stack.
To validate the sgt data, parsing it from layer and comparing with the expected.
